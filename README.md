## Initialization
### Conda Environment
In order to run the code, you need to create a conda environment using the `environment.yml` file.

Once the environment is created, activate the environment before running the scripts:

```bash
conda activate ai
```

Then run Jupyter Lab for the Jupyter Notebooks (*.ipynb).

```bash
jupyter lab
```
