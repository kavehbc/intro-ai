# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Conda Environment
In order to run the code, you need to create a conda environment using the `environment.yml` file.

```bash
conda create -f environment.yml
```

Once the environment is created, activate the environment before running the scripts:

```bash
conda activate ai
```

Now, you can run the scripts:

```bash
python code/csp-8-queen.py
```

or run Jupyter Lab for the Jupyter Notebooks (*.ipynb).

```bash
jupyter lab
```
